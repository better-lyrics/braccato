// -- Theme --------------------------------------------

// The element a theme handed to `setTheme` is applied through, one per document a renderer builds
// in. Named rather than anonymous because a consumer with a second document to style has to be able
// to find the first one: this extension's floating window mirrors the side panel's by id.
//
// One renderer per document owns it. Two renderers in one document render against one theme
// whatever they are given, because the settings registry is module scope, so this is a constraint
// stated rather than a configuration supported. A renderer that finds the id already in its
// document writes into that element rather than adding a rival, so the id stays unique and a
// consumer reading it by id gets the sheet in force, and `destroy` takes the element away only if
// this renderer is what put it there.
