// them. The directory is written as though it already lived on its own, which is how it survived
// being carved out of a browser extension and moved here without a line of it changing.
//
// Nothing under this directory may import from `@core/*`, `@modules/*`, `@constants`, `@utils`,
// `@options` or `@/`, reach outside the directory with a relative path, reference the extension
// global, or import a package. Nothing under `styles/` may name a YouTube Music selector, or read a

// past its published entry points. This file runs as part of `pnpm selfcheck`, and if a change
// makes it fail, the change is wrong, not the check.

// The one exemption: `*.selfcheck.ts` files may import `node:*` builtins and `typescript`. They are
// repo infrastructure, never bundled, and `typescript` is a devDependency of this repository.

// The extension global rule is not stylistic. On Firefox this module runs in the PAGE world, because
// Gecko hands content scripts a cross-origin wrapper on the Picture-in-Picture window. A single
// reference drags the webext polyfill into that bundle and kills it silently.
