// What this page tells a reader about @braccato/core, in one place so there is one place to change
// it. The page renders its reference and its code samples out of this file, and
// `tooling/check-api-docs.ts` reads the same file and holds every name in it against what
// `pnpm package` actually emitted. A property renamed in the module fails the package build
// rather than quietly leaving a wrong page on the screen.
//
// The prose here is the short answer. `packages/core/README.md` is the package page, and the page
// links to it rather than copying it: this file carries what a consumer needs to write the tag, and
// stops where the reasoning starts. The reasoning lives beside the code it explains, in the module's
// own file headers.

// -- The package --------------------------------------------

// `version` is checked against the emitted package.json, so the number on the page cannot drift from
// the number in the artifact. There is no separate README link, because both of these already land
// on it: npm renders the README as the package page, and GitHub renders it under the directory.
